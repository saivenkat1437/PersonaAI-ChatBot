# Persona-Based AI Chatbot Application

## Overview

This project implements an AI chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT models, designed to interact with users using a defined **persona**. The chatbot leverages prompt engineering techniques to simulate a consistent personality, tone, and expertise throughout the conversation, creating more engaging and meaningful interactions.

## Key Concepts and Learning Objectives

### 1. Large Language Models (LLMs)

- Utilize powerful transformer-based models like OpenAI GPT-4 to generate human-like responses.
- Understand how LLMs process input prompts and generate contextually relevant outputs.
- Learn how to call OpenAI API endpoints to integrate LLM capabilities into applications.

### 2. Persona and Prompt Engineering

- **Persona**: Defining a chatbot’s character or role through system-level instructions and prompt design.
- Learn how carefully crafted prompts influence AI behavior, tone, and knowledge.
- Explore techniques for building chatbots that maintain consistent personalities to improve user experience.

### 3. Conversational AI Design

- Maintain conversational context across multiple turns to ensure coherent dialogue.
- Handle challenges such as ambiguity, relevance, and consistency in chatbot responses.
- Design dialogue flows that feel natural and user-friendly.

### 4. Streamlit for Rapid Prototyping

- Build interactive web apps quickly using Streamlit’s Python framework.
- Manage UI components and session state effectively for real-time chat interfaces.
- Deploy AI-powered chatbots with minimal setup and code.

## How the Persona is Built

The chatbot’s persona is encoded through **system prompts** passed to the LLM. This system prompt defines:

- The chatbot’s tone (e.g., friendly, professional, casual)
- Knowledge domain (e.g., technical support, tutoring, general assistant)
- Behavioral guidelines (e.g., avoid slang, be concise, show empathy)

By conditioning the model with this prompt at the start of the conversation, every subsequent user query and model response aligns with the intended persona, creating a coherent and believable character.
